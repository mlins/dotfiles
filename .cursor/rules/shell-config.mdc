# Shell Configuration Guidelines

When working with shell configuration files:

## Zsh Configuration Structure
- `.zshrc` - Interactive shell configuration (aliases, functions, prompt)
- `.zprofile` - Login shell setup (environment variables, PATH)
- Keep configurations modular by sourcing separate files when complex

## Performance Best Practices
- Minimize startup time by avoiding heavy operations in `.zshrc`
- Use lazy loading for tools that aren't always needed
- Profile shell startup with `time zsh -i -c exit` to identify bottlenecks
- Consider using `zsh-defer` for non-critical initializations

## Code Organization
- Group related configurations with clear comments
- Use functions for complex logic instead of inline commands
- Keep aliases simple and memorable
- Document any non-obvious configurations

## Environment Variables
- Set PATH and other environment variables in `.zprofile`
- Use conditional checks for tool availability before adding to PATH
- Keep sensitive variables in separate, non-versioned files

## Powerlevel10k (p10k)
- Use `p10k configure` to generate initial configuration
- Keep custom modifications minimal and well-documented
- Test prompt performance with different git repository states

## Best Practices
- Test shell configurations in clean environments
- Use POSIX-compatible syntax when possible for portability
- Add error handling for optional tool integrations
- Document any manual setup steps required after stowing
